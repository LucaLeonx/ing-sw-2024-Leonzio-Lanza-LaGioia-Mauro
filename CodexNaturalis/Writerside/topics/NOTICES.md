# IMPORTANT NOTICES

For 23/04/2024: Represent with Sequence Diagrams the communication 
between Client and Server on the Network.

- Access to Game from a Player
- Player playing a Card from hand
- Player drawing a Card from Table

Add a (really) brief description to each diagram, in English.

- Activity intervals are not compulsory
- Message notation: MessageType(messageArgument1, messageArgument2),
  but any sensible choice is fine (e.g. JSON)

Add a folder "deliverables" where to place the diagrams
(you may add additional UML diagrams as well). Extra Sequence Diagrams
(other phases, communication between Model, View and Controller) are welcome
